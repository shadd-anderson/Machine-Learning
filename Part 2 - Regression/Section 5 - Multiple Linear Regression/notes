Simple linear regression:
y = mx + b (or y = b1x1 + x0)

Assumptions of a linear regression:
1. Linearity - it follows a linear correlation
2. Homoscedasticity - Regular, consistent variance among scatter plots
3. Multivariate normality - continuous variables follow normal distribution throughout
4. Independence of errors - points that don't follow the pattern are unique and lacking patterns themselves
5. Lack of multicollinearity - independent variables are, in fact, independent, and don't affect each other
