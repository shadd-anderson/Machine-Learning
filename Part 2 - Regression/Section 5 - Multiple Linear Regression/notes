Simple linear regression:
y = mx + b (or y = b1x1 + b0)

multiple variance linear regression:
y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn

Assumptions of a linear regression:
1. Linearity - it follows a linear correlation
2. Homoscedasticity - Regular, consistent variance among scatter plots
3. Multivariate normality - continuous variables follow normal distribution throughout
4. Independence of errors - points that don't follow the pattern are unique and lacking patterns themselves
5. Lack of multicollinearity - independent variables are, in fact, independent, and don't affect each other

p-values:
In complete simplicity: the chance that our data set can't be produced randomly based on the current model, or that it was affected by outside factors
